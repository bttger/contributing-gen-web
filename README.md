# Welcome to contributing-gen-web
This is the Web Frontend of [contributing-gen](https://github.com/bttger/contributing-gen) - The guideline to communicate how people should contribute to your project. It is made with Vue.js and serves as a simple client-only configurator to generate a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

Encourage people to contribute to your project with [your own contribution guide]().
